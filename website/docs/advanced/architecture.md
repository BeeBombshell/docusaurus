# Architecture

![Architecture overview](/img/architecture.png)

This image shows how Docusaurus works to build your app. Plugins each collect their content and emit JSON data; themes provide layout components which receive the JSON data as route modules. The bundler bundles all the components and emits a server bundle and a client bundle.

Although developers (either plugin authors or site creators) are writing JavaScript all the time, bear in mind that the JS is actually run in different environments:

- All plugin lifecycle methods are run in Node. Therefore, until we support ES Modules in our codebase, plugin source code must be provided as CommonJS that can be `require`'d.
- The theme code is built with Webpack. They can be provided as ESMâ€”following React conventions.

However, the theme being run in Webpack doesn't mean it always has access to browser globals! The theme is built twice:

- During **server-side rendering**, the theme is compiled in a sandbox called [React DOM Server](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom-server.html). You can see this as a "headless browser", where there is no `window` or `document`, only React. SSR produces static HTML pages.
- During **client-side rendering**, the theme is compiled with standard React DOM, and has access to browser variables.

Therefore, while you probably know not to access Node globals like `process` or the `'fs'` module, you can't freely access browser globals either. If you need to, you need to wrap your component with [`<BrowserOnly>`](../docusaurus-core.md#browseronly) to make sure it's invisible during SSR and only rendered in CSR.
